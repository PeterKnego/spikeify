It has the following features:\r\n\r\n - Maps database records to your Java objects, so you can simply work with your own classes.\r\n - Has a simple command-chain API for quick one-line access to most functionality.\r\n - Does not try to abstract or hide a native client library, but rather extend it. All functions of the underlying client lib can be  used concurrently with Spikeify.\r\n\r\nRead more about it in the [Basic Usage](https://github.com/Spikeify/spikeify/wiki/Basic-Usage).\r\n\r\nStatus: Spikeify is currently in Alpha, which means that API can still change. We plan to freeze the API and enter beta by the end of May '15.\r\n\r\nWhat works: object-record mapping, basic synchronous commands (get, create, update, delete, query, add/append/prepend) and transactions are working.\r\n\r\nWhat is not available yet: async operations, automatic index creation, custom field serializers, expiration field mapping queries on float/double values...\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
